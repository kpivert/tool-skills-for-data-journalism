# Reasons for Data J

"Gathering, filtering and visualizing what is happening beyond what the eye can see has a growing value. The orange juice you drink in the morning, the coffee you brew — **in today’s global economy there are invisible connections between these products, other people and you. The language of this network is data**: little points of information that are often not relevant in a single instance, but massively important when viewed from the right angle."

"Data analysis can provides us with a **new camera**." (David McCandless).

"When information was scarce, most of our efforts were devoted to hunting and gathering. Now that information is abundant, processing is more important."

###See something fast and remember

- understand a statement fast
- see a trend
- seeing is faster than reading
- powerful cognitive advantage: fully half of the human brain is devoted to processing visual information. When you present a user with an information graphic, you are reaching them through the mind’s highest-bandwidth pathway. Even after you’ve stopped looking it, a good data vis gets into your head and leaves a lasting mental model of a fact, trend or process.


###Provide an overview

- give the reader an overview where he is
- e.g. the bike tour around the wall, where you had the overview where you are)


###Communicate complexity in a simple way

- let the user understand a complex topic
- eg. see the data for ALL people)
- very close to the 2nd point


###Prove something with data

- form a new story with showing data
- investigative journalism, close to (social) science
- John Snow Cholera map

###Subjectify data
- Enable a reader to discover information that is personally relevant
- NYT Unemployment chart http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/11/06/business/economy/unemployment-lines.html
