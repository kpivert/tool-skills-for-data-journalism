"There is a mistake technical and scientific people make. We think that if we have made a clever and thoughful argument, based on data and smart analysis, then people will change their minds. This isn't true. If you want to change people's behaviou, you need to touch their hearts, not just win the argument. We call this the Oprah Winfrey rule." – Eric Schmidt, How Google works

With Data Journalism, we're moving a little bit away from that. Good journalism, especially the long-form one, used to tell us an story that brought us to laugh, to cry, to be upset – to have emotions.
With data, we see the overview and we can make better decisions, but these are not based on emotions.
