"There is a mistake technical and scientific people make. We think that if we have made a clever and thoughful argument, based on data and smart analysis, then people will change their minds. This isn't true. If you want to change people's behaviou, you need to touch their hearts, not just win the argument. We call this the Oprah Winfrey rule." – Eric Schmidt, How Google works

With Data Journalism, we're moving a little bit away from that. Good journalism, especially the long-form one, used to tell us an story that brought us to laugh, to cry, to be upset – to have emotions.
With data, we see the overview and we can make better decisions, but these are not based on emotions.

Gespräch mit Alexander (Politikwissenschaftler): "Erkenntnis um der Erkenntnis willen ist wichtig; dies kann dann langsam in einen gesellschaftlichen Diskurs eingehen. Die Welt ist komplex, und Revolutionen gehen langsam vonstatten." vs. "Ultimately, data visualization is about communicating an idea that will drive action."

How must data be to be valuable?
- interpretable (well-defined purpose)
- relevant (and not to much data) for the audience
  - who's the audience, which expectations do they have? --> "The New York Times trusts its readers to have the patience, maturity and the motivation to treasure the task of reading and learning from a graphic" & people in an art gallery will have a longer look on data vis as well, but not everybody can do that!
  - what should the graphic answer/communicate? "The strong journalistic culture of the graphics designers leads to exceptional clarity about the questions each visual piece is answering")
- novel
- qualitative good (complete, reliable)
- surrounded by context to make sense of it and gain insights out of it (e.g. text that explains what we can see, images)
- freed from biases (no log scale, y-axis etc.)da

What can data vis do?
- Education
- Exploration --> exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualization, e.g. finding patterns
- Confirmation (of a set of assumptions)
