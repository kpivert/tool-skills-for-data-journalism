# Rules


###Work with data

1. **How was the data collected?** <br>
What is the background for the data collection? e.g. "crime is on the rise" means only that more crimes are *reported*, but doesn't need to say anything about the crimes itself
2. How reliable is the information?
3. What was the intended purpose of the information collected?
2. When writing about an average, always think “an average of what?”
3. Is the reference population homogeneous?
4. Look for co-correlations! (Rich people drink tea, that doesn't mean that tea makes one healthier)
5. What do I know, what does it mean, and why do I believe it’s important?”
6. what information is most valuable to my audience?
7. what action(s) do I want to incite?


Reporting in natural frequencies (1 in 100) is way easier for readers to understand that using percentage (1%).

Trying to be objective with data:
If you believe in data, try to let it speak before you slap on your own mood, beliefs or expectations. There’s so much data about that you will often be able to find confirmation of your prior beliefs if you simply look around a bit. Data Journalism is only as objective as you strive to make it, and not by virtue of being based on numbers.

In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset we are already full of expectations and assumptions about the data. Usually there is a reason why we are interested that dataset that we are looking at. It’s a good idea to start the documentation by writing down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and reduces the risk of mis-interpretation of the data by just finding what we originally wanted to find.
take the time to make some notes on things like: **What does this chart tell me?**

Often, such a visual analysis of a new dataset feels like an exciting journey to an unknown country. You start as a foreigner with just the data and your assumptions, but with every step you make, with every chart you render, you get new insights about the topic. Based on those insights you make decisions for your next steps and what issues are worth further investigation.



###Write the story
- Give the reader an answer to **WHY BOTHER**, e.g., when showing traffic deaths, tell him what he should avoid
- To draw your readers in you have to be able to hit them with a headline figure that makes them sit up and take notice. You should almost be able to read the story without having to know that it comes from a dataset.
- decide on the overwhelming impression you want a reader to get, and make everything else disappear. In many cases, this means removing information even when the Internet allows you to provide everything.
