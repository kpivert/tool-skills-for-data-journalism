# Data Journalism: Rules


### High-level

- Give the reader an answer to **WHY BOTHER**, e.g., when showing traffic deaths, tell him what he should avoid

-  Would a graphic offer **any additional value?** No graphic needs to be created if the entire content can be outlined in one sentence

- induce an AHA moment!

- Is the expected outcome / impact **worth** working on that graphic?

- the content needs to claim for more attention than the form. **The form shouldn't be more complicated than the content**. (Don't go to crazy and show your data in wild innovative visualizations)

- Data Journalism is only as **objective** as you strive to make it, and not by virtue of being based on numbers.

### How must data be to be valuable?
- interpretable (well-defined purpose)
- relevant (and not to much data) for the audience
  - who's the audience, which expectations do they have? --> "The New York Times trusts its readers to have the patience, maturity and the motivation to treasure the task of reading and learning from a graphic"
  - what should the graphic answer/communicate? "The strong journalistic culture of the graphics designers leads to exceptional clarity about the questions each visual piece is answering")
- novel (really?)
- qualitative good (complete, reliable)
- surrounded by context to make sense of it and gain insights out of it (e.g. text that explains what we can see, images)
- freed from biases (no log scale, y-axis etc.)da

What can data vis do?
- Education
- Exploration --> exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualization, e.g. finding patterns
- Confirmation (of a set of assumptions)

<br>
### Low-level (practical)

-  **How was the data collected?** <br>
What is the background for the data collection? e.g. "crime is on the rise" means only that more crimes are *reported*, but doesn't need to say anything about the crimes itself

- When writing about an average, always think “an average of what?”

- What do I know and **why do I believe it’s important**?

- what information is **most valuable** to my audience? With which information can my audience navigate this world better? Which informations build useful beliefs?

- what action(s) do I want to incite?

- Reporting in natural frequencies (1 in 100) is way easier for readers to understand that using percentage (1%).
