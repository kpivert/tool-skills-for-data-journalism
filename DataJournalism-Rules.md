# Data Journalism: Rules


### High-level

- Give the reader an answer to **WHY BOTHER**, e.g., when showing traffic deaths, tell him what he should avoid

-  Would a graphic offer **any additional value?** No graphic needs to be created if the entire content can be outlined in one sentence

- induce an AHA moment!

- Is the expected outcome / impact **worth** working on that graphic?

- the content needs to claim for more attention than the form. **The form shouldn't be more complicated than the content**. (Don't go to crazy and show your data in wild innovative visualizations)

- Data Journalism is only as **objective** as you strive to make it, and not by virtue of being based on numbers.

### How must data be to be valuable?
- interpretable (well-defined purpose)
- relevant (and not to much data) for the audience
  - who's the audience, which expectations do they have? --> "The New York Times trusts its readers to have the patience, maturity and the motivation to treasure the task of reading and learning from a graphic"
  - what should the graphic answer/communicate? "The strong journalistic culture of the graphics designers leads to exceptional clarity about the questions each visual piece is answering")
- novel (really?)
- qualitative good (complete, reliable)
- surrounded by context to make sense of it and gain insights out of it (e.g. text that explains what we can see, images)
- freed from biases (no log scale, y-axis etc.)da

What can data vis do?
- Education
- Exploration --> exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualization, e.g. finding patterns
- Confirmation (of a set of assumptions)

### Low-level (practical)

-  **How was the data collected?** <br>
What is the background for the data collection? e.g. "crime is on the rise" means only that more crimes are *reported*, but doesn't need to say anything about the crimes itself

- When writing about an average, always think “an average of what?”

- What do I know and **why do I believe it’s important**?

- what information is **most valuable** to my audience? With which information can my audience navigate this world better? Which informations build useful beliefs?

- what action(s) do I want to incite?

- Reporting in natural frequencies (1 in 100) is way easier for readers to understand that using percentage (1%).


In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset we are already full of expectations and assumptions about the data. Usually there is a reason why we are interested that dataset that we are looking at. It’s a good idea to start the documentation by writing down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and reduces the risk of mis-interpretation of the data by just finding what we originally wanted to find.
take the time to make some notes on things like: **What does this chart tell me?**

Often, such a visual analysis of a new dataset feels like an exciting journey to an unknown country. You start as a foreigner with just the data and your assumptions, but with every step you make, with every chart you render, you get new insights about the topic. Based on those insights you make decisions for your next steps and what issues are worth further investigation.



###Write the story
- Give the reader an answer to **WHY BOTHER**, e.g., when showing traffic deaths, tell him what he should avoid
- To draw your readers in you have to be able to hit them with a headline figure that makes them sit up and take notice. You should almost be able to read the story without having to know that it comes from a dataset.
- decide on the overwhelming impression you want a reader to get, and make everything else disappear. In many cases, this means removing information even when the Internet allows you to provide everything.
