# Statistics


###Data Types
= Levels of Measurement.

You can go up, but you can't go down (e.g. ratio data can be transformed into ordinal data, but not the other way roudn!)

| Type | Example | Explanation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Nominal | "German", "English" | Differention in names |
| Ordinal | "1: short line", "2: fast line" | Differention in rankings |
| Interval | 11.15 – 11.30 Uhr; 20°C | Differentiaon in the degree of difference. But 20°C is not double as hot as 10°C |
| Ratio | 16 years, $30 | Differention with raw and calculatable numbers |


**Discrete data** = Integer, e.g. people (there can't be a 3,42th person, only a third and a fourth person)<br>
**Continous data** = Float, e.g. milk liter (there can be a 3.24l of milk, and a 3.25l etc...)


###Level of Aggregation


| Level | Example | Explanation |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Factoid | "36.7% of coffee in 2000 was consumed by women." | Piece of trivia to emphasize something |
| Series | 2000:19t, <br>2001:23t, <br>2002:25t | Dependent data (sales/mass) compared with independent data (time/plantes) |
| Multi-Series | 2000: 3t(Germans) and 2t(British), <br>2001: 5t(Germans) and 4t (British) | Several dependent data compared with one independent data (time) |
| Summable multiseries | 2000: 13t(Males) and 6t(Females), <br>2001: 20t(Males) and 3t (Females) | Particular statistic (gender, type of coffee) segmented into subgroups. Can be summed up. |
| Summary records | Jane:female, regular coffee:3, decaf:2; <br>Tim: male, regular coffee:1, decaf:5 | The kind of data a point-of-sale system at a café might generate. Categories can be combined ("How many females drank regular coffee?") |
| Individual transactions | Jane: 17.01, 1 regular coffee;<br>Tim: 17.03, 1 decaf | Capture things about a specific event.  |
