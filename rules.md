# Rules


- Give the reader an answer to **WHY BOTHER**, e.g., when showing traffic deaths, tell him what he should avoid
- no graphic needs to be created if the entire content can be outlined in one sentence
- do the results make a special or unexpected statement? Would a graphic offer any additional value?
- a cost evaluation needs to be made to assure the amounts of the invested resources corresponds to the benefits. (Preis-Leistung: Mit wievielen Lesern kann gerechnet werden?)
- induce an AHA moment!
- the content needs to claim for more attention than the form. The form shouldn't be more complicated than the content. (Don't go to crazy and show your data in wild innovative visualizations)
